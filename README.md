The objective of the  Weather Forecast web app provides real-time weather information for a specified location. It allows users to search for their city or region and displays weather data, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description (e.g., "sunny," "cloudy"). The app fetches data from a weather API, making it dynamic and real-time.

**Weather Data Display:** Shows the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions (like sunny, rainy).

**Location Autocomplete:** Optional feature to suggest city names as the user types.

**Real-time Data:** Fetches weather information dynamically using a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API).

**Responsive UI:** The design adjusts to different screen sizes for mobile and desktop use.

### Tecnologies Used:

**HTML:**For building the appâ€™s structure (input field, search button, weather details).

**CSS:**  To style the app and make it visually appealing with weather icons, temperature readings, etc.

**Key CSS concepts:** Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries

**JavaScript:**  Handles user input and API calls to fetch weather data, processes the response, and displays it in the app.

**Key JavaScript concepts:** Event Listeners, DOM Manipulation.
